# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This project is a study guide made to help through out the prework, and starting modules of this bootcamp. This study guide will help retain and solidify information to aid in my transition to a new career path. This solves the problem of having to go back and reference hand written notes, or sift through course material to reference pertinent information. I have learned the basics of how to use the git workflow in a professional web development environment, and how HTML, CSS, and Javascript interact with each other to form a functioning web application. This knowledge and these skills will be vital in my journey forward learning to code.
